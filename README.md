***##In this repository I will start uploading all my practices with Truffle and Ganache.***
***##All of them are found in the "contracts" folder.***


## UserManager
 Practicing more solidity but using Truffle and Ganache

 In "truffle console" I have used the following commands to test the code:
  1) admin = await Manager.deployed()
  
  2) admin.register(23,"Juan","Male")
        *to register a user*

        *Now we will consult about said user with his address*
  3) admin.consult()   

        *and now we will delete it, sorry :(*
  4) admin._delete()


-*later I must try doing tests, in the corresponding folder*
